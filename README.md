This repository contains a version of Javascript and HTML5 based classic 90s tennis game which was done with the help of a Udemy course "Code Your First Game: Arcade Classic in JavaScript on Canvas" by Chris DeLeon

I have tried to built this game to learn something about how things work on canvas and get know more about Javascript, HTML5 and CSS

The Table Tennis Game is a simple project developed using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML canvas. This game is an interesting game. The player has to move the stick like a TT bat to reflect the ball back to the opponent and make a score. This game helps players practice to build their concentration power too.
